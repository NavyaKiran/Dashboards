This is a simple but intuitive dashboard. I developed it using Walmart data from the years, 2011 - 2015. 
Some of the questions answered by this dashboard are : 
* What is the total sales, profit, quantity sold, avg days for delivery across all the five years? Also, what are the total sales for each individual year?
* On a map, represent the location of stores across the US. Also, we can filter that based on year. 
* What are the sales by category of product? 
* What kind of products brought in the most profit?
* What are the most profit earning states?
* What are the states earning a loss?
* What category of products are profitable? 

Based on the results, the following recommendations can be made to the stakeholder (Walmart): 
* Invest more in states bringing in profit. Analyse gaps in store locations, so it is more accessible. This can be done by developing a python script
  to find the distance between stores and then recommending store locations at places where there are no stores, but there exists a town/city. 
* Reconsider keeping stores open in locations incurring losses and invest that in profitable locations. 
* Try reducing the avg days to delivery by ensuring better supply chain connectivity. Maybe more customers will start ordering then. 
* Ensure profitable products are always in stock in locations. 
* As you see in the dashboard, people buy products that are supposedly expensive (phones, chairs, tables, etc). 
  So, maybe consider improving the variety. 
* Most of the locations are on the west coast according to the map, maybe consider investing in east coast locations to assess their profitability? 
  Conduct surveys and interviews to determine whether people would consider shopping there?
